    "Here is a lightweight simulation of the Monty Hall Problem using numpy. Commonsense might suggest that once you have seen the goat door, the probability that our door has the prize is 1/2, and so there's no reason to switch. However, \n",
    "as you can see, switching doors is the more successful strategy. This is because the probability that our original door had the prize is 1/3, whereas the probability our door did not have the prize is 2/3. Being shown the \"goat\" door yields no additional information:\n",

    "This follows from the fact that no matter which door you pick originally, you can always be shown a goat door, and so this probability is 1. In formal terms, the two events are independent. \n",
